Some stuff I want to implement but seems either to advanced or not really necessary right now

shadow overlay for the map markers

animations on the markers for when they are added and removed

back to top btn

num views on each roadtrip

users can request collaboration on a roadtrip

custom checkboxes

search bar component

for the user select form, instead of checkboxes use the user's profile photo and just turn the opacity to low and when clicked full opacity. Photo acts like the checkbox

maybe groups of people who go on trips together often can create a group so that when they create a roadtrip it automatically adds everyone in the group as collaborators

change nav url piece color on hover

algorithm for sorting replies so some don't get thrown to the bottom everytime.

when you go to reply, the screen scrolls down to reply box because sometimes it shows up off the page.
