New roadtrip form on scroll scrolls the main page stuff.

user profile image outline shape is a square which leads to change of cursor before mouse is over circle

when creating a new roadtrip and selecting collaborators, you can select yourself. The only thing I can think to do is automatically remove yourself from collaborators when uploading the data. So to the user, it looks like they're a collaborator but really not.

when new comment is added, delete btn doesn't show when it should when replying non-root

can't delete two comments in a row -> shuts down server

when adding root comment, server shorts

icon button doesn't change color on click. Waits for mouse to exit.

when deleting a stop from the roadtrip page, the 404 api endpoint error is thrown. This might just have to do with the test data server idk. It's not being called twice.

manually selecting a marker takes a long time (sometimes). sometimes, it fixes itself with a page refresh (it's kind of random)

the comment section adding new comment. when scrolling after added comment, scrolls past comment
